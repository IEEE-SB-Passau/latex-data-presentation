\section{Introduction}

When writing a seminar paper or a thesis, students often do experimentation
work.  Often, a large amount of data is being produced in this process.  For the
paper or thesis, they need to analyze the data and provide it in a way that is
easy to understand but fulfills formal requirements in terms of validity and
correctness.

Many students will be pointed to the usage of \LaTeX{}, a typesetting systems
invented by Donald E\@. Knuth and Leslie Lamport.  Although, most of the things
mentioned in this work is of general nature and can also be applied to other
systems, we restrict our presentation to \LaTeX.
