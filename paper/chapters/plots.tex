\section{Plots}

In this section, we want to focus on different examples of plots.  We restrict
our presentation to \toolname{pgfplots} because it is the tool we use most;
every example can be done with the other tools, respectively.  The raw data that
is used in the examples can be found in the supplementary GitHub
repository\footnoteref{footnote-github} and on the supplementary web
page\footnoteref{footnote-webpage}.
