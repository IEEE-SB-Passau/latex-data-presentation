# LaTeX Data Presentation

This repository contains all examples, slides, documents and additional data for
the talk “LaTeX Data Presentation” held by me for the IEEE Student Branch Passau
on 2016-06-16.

In order to compile the *.tex files, we suggest to have an up-to-date TeX
distribution, e.g., TeX Live 2015 or 2016 with all updates installed.

All examples as pdf files can be found on the
[supplementary webpage](https://research.lukasczyk.me/latex-data-presentation)
